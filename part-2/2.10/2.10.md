## 2.10
Update `API_URL` for frontend service from `localhost:8000` to `/api` since nginx proxies all requests to `http://backend:8000` to `/api/`  

Also noticed there was some issues with db connection with the previous build (2.6), I have to switch to a ubuntu base instead of a node base for backend service
